            <ol style="list-style: none;padding-left: 2rem !important">
                <li>
                    <p>2.1. The Company provides a service granting limited, non-exclusive, and non-transferable access to digital content, as defined by each service plan's description.
                     </p>
                </li>  <br>
                <li>
                     <p>2.2. To enjoy the service, the User must have internet access and a compatible device with the platform. Please note that the quality of content viewing may vary based on the device used and can be influenced by factors like location, available bandwidth, and internet connection speed.
                     </p>
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                     <p>2.3. Digital content plans (videos, games, etc.) are subject to the prices and durations specified in the active plans during the subscription. Unless the User communicates their desire to cancel, subscriptions will automatically renew. To cancel, a 14 day notice must be given via the personal account or by contacting customer service. The cancellation will take effect 14 days after the communication.
                     </p>

                <li>
                     <p>2.4. Alternatively, the User can opt for immediate cancellation without the 14 day notice by selecting this option in their personal account and making a final payment of 9.70€.

                <li>
                     <p>2.5. Upon cancellation, access to content will cease at the end of the billing cycle. Users can switch to a lower or higher content plan at any time via their personal account, and the change will take effect from the next payment charge. Failure to pay the full price of the current plan will lead to an automatic downgrade to the plan below, with access to the basic plan costing                         9.70€ 
                                                                                                                                                            .
